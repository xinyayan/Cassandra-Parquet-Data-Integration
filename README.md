# Cassandra-Parquet Data Integration and gRPC Implementation

## Project Overview

This project showcases the efficient management and processing of a substantial dataset containing 123,346 lines of GHCNd stations data. The focus of this project has been on data handling and optimization, integrating Cassandra databases with Apache Spark to streamline data processing and storage. Key aspects include the use of Apache Spark for data conversion to the Parquet format and the implementation of gRPC for effective client-server communication.

### Features

- **Data Handling**: Efficient management of a large GHCNd stations dataset.
- **Cassandra Integration**: Leveraging Cassandra databases for enhanced data storage and retrieval.
- **Apache Spark Utilization**: Utilizing Spark for efficient data processing and conversion to Parquet format.
- **gRPC Implementation**: Establishing robust client-server communication to enhance CQL query processing.

### Prerequisites

- Apache Cassandra
- Apache Spark
- gRPC
